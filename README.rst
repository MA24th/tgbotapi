Getting started
---------------

This API is tested with

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9

There are two ways to install the framework:

* Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

    ``$ pip install tgbotapi``

* Installation from source (requires git):

    ``$ git clone https://github.com/ma24th/tgbotapi.git``

    ``$ cd tgbotapi``

    ``$ pip install .``

It is generally recommended to use the first option.
::

    While the API is production-ready, it is still under development and it has regular updates,
    do not forget to update it regularly by calling ``pip install tgbotapi --upgrade``
