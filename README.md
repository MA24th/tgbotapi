> Based On [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)
## Getting Started

This API is tested with:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8

There are two ways to install the framework:

* Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

```bash
pip install tgbotapi
```

* Installation from source (requires git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ma24th/tgbotapi.git
cd tgbotapi
pip install .
```

It is generally recommended to use the first option.

*While the API is production-ready, it is still under development and it has regular updates, do not forget to update it regularly by calling `pip install tgbotapi --upgrade`*
